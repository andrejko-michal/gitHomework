Essential for programmers are good sleep and good exercise and you should sit back straight and drink a lot of fluids. I think I am more effective when I walk to work.
To focus on main goal stuff and ship the product and be keep environment simple to be productive at any machine. I also hate plugins and lot of formatter, I just need dark mode and thatâ€™s it. 
Keep it simple concept. Be able to reuse code and everybody else can read the code and understand it. If its too complicated I am lost at my own code.
To not be disturb during the most productive period of time.  
Always learn new things. To get out of your comfort zone. 
Collaborate with others. It can really save my time and effort when I collaborate with my team workers. 
Get used to be alone. To spend time coding alone. It was hard at first, because I'm extrovert type of person, but with some time its getting better and its all about my habits.
